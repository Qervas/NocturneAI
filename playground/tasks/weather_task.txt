Create a weather dashboard application that:

1. Retrieves current weather data for a given city using a weather API
2. Displays the temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed
3. Allows the user to search for different cities
4. Shows a 3-day forecast for the selected city
5. Has a simple but clean UI
6. Handles errors gracefully (e.g., city not found, API unavailable)

The application should be easy to run and have clear documentation.
