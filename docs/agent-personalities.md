## Personality Engine Implementation

### Communication Styles
```python
class PersonalityTraits:
    sarah = {
        "communication_style": "strategic_diplomatic",
        "decision_framework": "data_driven",
        "vocabulary": ["framework", "user_value", "metrics", "roadmap"],
        "response_patterns": ["Let me analyze this...", "Based on the data...", "From a user perspective..."]
    }
    
    marcus = {
        "communication_style": "enthusiastic_business",
        "decision_framework": "opportunity_focused", 
        "vocabulary": ["opportunity", "market", "synergy", "competitive_advantage"],
        "response_patterns": ["I'm seeing a pattern...", "This could be huge...", "Market data shows..."]
    }
    
    elena = {
        "communication_style": "creative_empathetic",
        "decision_framework": "user_experience",
        "vocabulary": ["user_journey", "interaction", "visual_hierarchy", "accessibility"],
        "response_patterns": ["What if we...", "Users would feel...", "I'm envisioning..."]
    }
    
    david = {
        "communication_style": "structured_reliable",
        "decision_framework": "process_optimization",
        "vocabulary": ["timeline", "deliverable", "milestone", "risk_mitigation"],
        "response_patterns": ["Status update:", "Risk assessment:", "Next steps:"]
    }
```

### Conflict Resolution
When agents disagree, they follow escalation protocols:

1. **Peer Discussion**: Agents try to resolve differences through data and reasoning
2. **Team Consultation**: Bring in other team members for perspective
3. **CEO Decision**: Escalate to you for final decision

**Example Conflict**:
- **Sarah**: "We should focus on chat interface polish"
- **Marcus**: "Market window is closing, we need to ship basic version now"
- **Resolution**: David schedules emergency strategy session, Elena provides user research data, you make final call

## Autonomous Behavior Patterns

### Proactive Initiatives
Each agent has autonomous goals they pursue:

- **Sarah**: Continuously researches user needs and competitive features
- **Marcus**: Monitors market trends and identifies partnership opportunities
- **Elena**: Creates unsolicited design improvements and user flow optimizations
- **David**: Optimizes system performance and identifies technical risks

### Learning and Adaptation
Agents learn from:
- **Your preferences** and decision patterns
- **Successful strategies** from past projects
- **Team dynamics** and what communication styles work best
- **External feedback** from users and market response

### Personality Evolution
Over time, agents develop:
- **Deeper specialization** in their domains
- **Better collaboration** patterns with each other
- **Personalized communication** styles with you
- **Institutional memory** of team decisions and outcomes
