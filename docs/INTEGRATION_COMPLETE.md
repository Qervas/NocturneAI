## 🎊 **CONCLUSION**

**The Step 1 prototype has been successfully implemented and integrated!** 

The ability system provides a solid foundation for building task-capable agents with coding and research abilities. The architecture follows the "less dumb" principle by being extensible, well-structured, and ready for incremental improvement rather than complete rebuilds.

**Ready for Step 2: Replace mocks with real implementations and add domain-specific composite abilities!** 🚀
